## How it works

The languages are used a bit different in different enviroments. If the language does not exists it will however always fallback to english.

### Panel

In the panel the language is taken from the logged in user profile.

### Frontend single language

On a single language setup the language is taken from the browser language.

### Frontend multi languages

On a multi language setup the language is taken from the chosen language.

## Voting

When voting on a page, that vote is added for all languages. That's because it's still the same page even if it has multiple translations.
